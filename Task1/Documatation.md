## ER Diagram
 
 - An entity-relationship diagram, or ER diagram, is essential for modeling the data stored in a database. It is the basic design upon which a database is built. ER diagrams specify what data we will store: the entities and their attributes. They also show how entities relate to other entities.
 - ER diagrams are used to analyze existing databases to find and resolve problems in logic or deployment. Drawing the diagram should reveal where it's going wrong.
